 *
 *  Note:  The primary activity will be to 'sync' with the main FIRST FTC SDK repository (ftctechnh/ftc_app)
 *         when they release new updates to the SDK.  (using STEP 5 frequently)

1. Fork the orginal ftc SDK into our Organization
2. Create a new Repository for Rover-Ruckus
3. Go into Rover-Ruckus Repository and IMPORT from the forked version FTC997/ftc_app

   - This should copy the files from the "forked" version into our Teams Rover Ruckus
     project workspace.

4. Next setup a method to keep your forked copy in sync with First ftctechnh/ftc_app (The original SDK put out by FIRST), do the following:



  Keeping your FORKED repository in sync with the main FIRST SDK  (ftctechnh/ftc_app)

     Pre-requisite:
        - Andrioid Studio should NOT BE RUNNING AT THIS TIME...


	    1. On your local laptop, cd to the directory were the .git directory is located.
	       For CS team, this should be under /Documents/FTC/2018/Programming/


	    2. Verify which repository's you currently see.  You should see something similare to:

			    $ git remote -v
				origin	https://github.com/FTC9977/ftc_app.git (fetch)
				origin	https://github.com/FTC9977/ftc_app.git (push)


	    3. from the command line issue:
	         git remote add upstream https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app.git


        4. Re-validate your repository listings.  You should see this now:


			$ git remote -v
			origin	https://github.com/FTC9977/ftc_app.git (fetch)
			origin	https://github.com/FTC9977/ftc_app.git (push)
			upstream	https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app.git (fetch)  <--- NEW
			upstream	https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app.git (push)	  <--- NEW


	    NOTE:  You only need to perform steps 1-4 ONCE...  You will be issues the commands below to sync up the FTC SDK from the orginal (ftctechnh/ftc_app)....



	    5.  Now to sync your Forked repository with the FIRST FTC SDK (orginal), do the following from the command line:

	         git pull upstream master



    Example 1:  Tried to SYNC, but already in an updated status:


			$ git pull upstream master
			From https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app
			 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
			Already up-to-date.


	Example 2:  Updates to main FTC SDK have been release, now syncing our local copy  (TBD)
